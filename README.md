## Installation
In order to generate your README file, you should start by opening your console and running `npm install` to install the npm dependencies contained in the `package.json`:
* Install `inquirer` by entering `npm i inquirer` which enables you to get inputs from users.

To run the README generator you simply just enter `node index.js` in the console when you switch to the folder it is located.

## Usage
To use the application just make sure the npm inquirer dependency has been installed then run the file in the console. You would be prompted for a series of questions on the content you would want in your README. When it is ended, you should see a message in the console saying your README has been generated.
