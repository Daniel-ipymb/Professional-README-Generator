## Description
A README.md file generator created with javascript to relieve developers of the stress of writing the entire readme. It contains a quality professional built-in readme that takes in user informations and automatically generates a readme file.

## Installation
In order to generate your README file, you should start by opening your console and running `npm install` to install the npm dependencies contained in the `package.json`:
* `inquirer` by entering `npm i inquirer` which enables you to get inputs from users.

To run the README generator you simply just enter `node index.js` in the console when you switch to the folder it is located.

## Usage
Developers are welcome to contribute to my project by forking the repo or starring the repo and making their changes

I carried my tests by running `node index.js` in the console then answering the prompts and the readme was generated.
